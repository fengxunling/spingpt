So, in these images we have a sagittal and axial view of a T2 MRI of the cervical spine starting with C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, T1. 
Here is the anterior part of the spine and posterior. 
Looking anteriorly, the spine appears to be in good alignment with normal lordosis. 
The same is true for the posterior aspect of the spine where we have the spinous processes here. 
Medially, we have the spinal cord coming down. 
CSF here is bright. 
Superior, there is the cerebellum and the pons and the medulla. 
There is no obvious central canal stenosis or cord compression. 
Discs all appear to be normal height at C2, C3, C4, C5, C6. 
The C6-7 disc shows a slight bulge with displacement of CSF, however, no compression on the fecal sac. 
Starting at the axial views. 
Starting at the C2-3 disc space. 
The foramen appear patent. 
Here we have the dorsal and ventral nerve roots and the neural foramen here. 
Again, everything looks patent and normal. C3-4 disc space. 
Again, we see the ventral and dorsal roots and the foramen look patent. 
C4-5 the same. 
C5-6 similarly dorsal root, neural foramen are patent. 
C6-7 This appears to be flipped. C6-7
