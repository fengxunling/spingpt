 We are looking at the cervical MRI T2 weighted of this patient. 
 On the right we have a sagittal image, on the left we have an axial image. 
 First we will take a look at the sagittal image. 
 This is the sagittal T2 weighted MRI within the mid-sagittal plane. 
 So anteriorly we have the vertebral bodies starting at C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, T1. 
 Posteriorly we can see the spinous processes as well. 
 This is C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C7, T1. 
 There appears to be some hypo-intensity within several levels of the disc space suggesting degenerative process. 
 Also at level C6, C7 we see a slight disc protrusion within the mid-sagittal plane that is causing mild canal stenosis at that level. 
 The spinal cord does not appear to have any compression. 
 There is CSF indicated here around the spinal cord. 
 Cerebellum is up here and you can just see part of the brain stem as well. 
 The cervical spine appears to be in good alignment with normal lordosis. 
 As we move laterally, we can see the facet joints with good alignment. 
 Here are the facet joints. 
 Again moving laterally looking at the facet joints, there appears to be good alignment. 
 Now focusing on the axial P2 here. 
 We're starting at the C2, C3 disc space. This is the C3, C4 disc space. 
 You can see the spinal cord centrally with CSF around it, the neuroforamen laterally where the nerve roots are exiting. 
 Then we have the disc space, the disc in the spinous process posteriorly. 
 Here we can see the spinal cord. Here we can see the dorsal nerve roots exiting the neuroforamen laterally. 
 This is the ventral motor root also exiting the foramen laterally. There's no obvious compression of nerve roots laterally. 
 Overall this seems to be a cervical MRI where there's no clear central canal stenosis. There's no clear neuroforamen stenosis. 
 Again this is C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, T1, T2, T3. 
 At T3, T4 there appears to be a slight kyphosis deformity. 
 But otherwise this is a normal appearing cervical MRI.
