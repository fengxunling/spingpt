 Alright, so here we have axial T2 on the left on the right, we have the sagittal T2. So here there were t-bow bodies and here are the disc space. This is the spinous process. I can't tell what level we're at because I can't see L5. But here's the conist, so I'm guessing that this is around L1. I... So it's difficult to tell from this image due to artifact from the screws. But there appears to be a chyphotic deformity at a hunched clear what level in the thoracic spine due to the artifact. It's unclear what pathology is occurring within the spinal cord, but it appears that there may be some hyperintensity suggesting a lesion within the spinal cord at this level. The clonus we can see the nerve roots, the cato-quina coming down on the axial. The clonus ends here and it appears that there's no canal stenosis within the lumbar spine. Again due to artifact, it's difficult to tell on the axial MRI if there's any pathology around where the screws are placed.
